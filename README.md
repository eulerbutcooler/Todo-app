## TODO APP

https://toodoo-flj9.onrender.com

- Deployed it on render. 

This project uses MERN stack to make a very simple todo app.

*Features* :

- Create a todo that is saved in a mongodb cluster.
- Mark the todo as done when the task is done.
- Delete the todo.

UPDATE 1:

- Empty todos can't be created now.
- Scrollbar for better readability and accessibility.
- Input boxes clear after addind a todo.

I'll be adding more features and fixing the bugs every week.

``` There are some bugs in the code for instance the added todo doesn't appear on the page until you refresh the page. ```
